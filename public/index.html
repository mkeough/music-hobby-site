        One of my favorite things to do is listen to music. I like all genres of
        music. Doesnt matter if its classical or rap or country. I really like
        when i find a new band or song ive never heard of before. Going to see
        live music is awesome. Music festivals are one of my favorite things to
        do with my friends. Everyone is there just to listen to music and have a
        good time. Some are my favorite memories are being a t a concert with my
        friends and family. The best thing about music is that it brings people
        together.
